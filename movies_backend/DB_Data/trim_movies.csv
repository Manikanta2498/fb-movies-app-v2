Now, imagine being tasked to do a sequel to ALIEN. You'd be right to directly spray your pants, go throw up, have a heart attack and then politely decline. But not James Cameron. He went on and made one of the most valuable and memorable sequels in film history, despite having a lot of nay-sayers in his own team who didn't believe he could pull it off. Oh, the balls this guy had...Well, what can I tell you about this film that you don't already know? If you really haven't seen it, go watch it. Immediately. It basically is the American version of the suspenseful, British original, but it does get to expand on the world-building quite a lot, as well as on Ripley herself. Add Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton and a ton of Xenomorphs, paranoia, action, quite a bit of horror, Paul Reiser and Lance Henriksen and a badass called Vasquez, and you will have a cocktail that you won't forget, I promise.

It suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness. But overall, this movie worked. All the elements aligned just right, and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film. Most of that, I think, is due to Jamie Foxx. I don't know who tagged Foxx for the lead, but whoever it was did this movie a big favor. Believable and amazingly likeable, Foxx glides through the movie, smooth as butter and funnier than hell. You can tell he's working on instinct, and instinct doesn't fail him.The plot, while unimportant, actually ties together pretty well, and there's even a character arc through which Foxx's character grows as a person. Again, they could've slipped by without any of this, but it just makes things that much better.I'm surprised at the low rating for this. Maybe I just caught this move on the right night, or vice versa, but I'd give it a 7/10. Bravo, Mssr.

The movie I saw on basic cable this morning would barely rate PG. Massive cuts and edits were evident all through the film. Entire scenes were removed. The dialog was edited so that you'd think it was made in the 1950's. The hilarious masturbation scene was edited in such a way that it appeared Linda walked in on Brad while he was peeing. (They actually ran the film backwards during this scene.) Even some of the musical soundtrack had changed, due to rights issues I'd guess...My point is, if you've only seen this movie on basic cable, you really haven't seen this movie.

Certainly it's the best teen comedy ever made. Why? Because in spite of its highly stylized depiction of teenagers, it caught the truest essence of what high school is actually like in America. Not only that, it trashed the entire genre and-- in a feat of sheer genius-- even the *reaction* to the genre by outside observers (namely parents). Terry Southern could have done no better...""Westerburg high school self-destructed not *because* of society but because Westerburg High School *was* society"" was restated, to near-universal praise, by Michael Moore in ""Bowling For Columbine"", but Waters said it before him, said it better, and frankly he's got a lot more credibility (""Hudson Hawk"" notwithstanding). The cast is brilliant, even if, strangely, some of them don't seem to get what the whole movie was about. You half expect that most of the cast and crew, like the kids who sign a petition to bring Big Fun to the school for a gig, made a movie they didn't know they were making. But the key figures nailed it-- Ryder and Slater were never better...""Heathers"" is one of the best films of the Eighties-- put the lid on the Eighties, as it were. It has suffered criminal neglect, probably because it may have required an ""indie auteur"" to really knock the cinematic elements out of the park. The direction is competent but unspectacular. Still, the star is the writing, and Waters deserved an Oscar for this script. Unsentimental, vicious, and above all hilariously funny, he drove a stake through the heart of those oh-so-precious John Hughes films and, at the same time, set the stage for Kevin Williamson and all the rest. He did it with a perfect ear for dialogue combined with a Swiftian vision of social structures, and did it all as an argument *against* ironic detachment, for which this film and its messages needs to be revisited now more than ever.

I had never seen the trailer, and I would recommend not seeing the trailer...A main complaint from those who don't like it seems to be there are enough bad people; I actually found this refreshing. I don't meet many bad, evil people in my every day life; most people are pretty cool, I find. I actually felt the fundamental premise of the movie was realistic and I appreciated that it was willing to skip ahead and not spell out every beat. Or fill in the backstory. A good film can choose the story it wants to tell and does not need to fill in every interstitial space or to mimic the way things would necessarily unfold in the real world. I suppose it could be a realistic criticism that things could never quite happen this way, but it certainly did not bother me. I thought this film portrays people - and I mean all the characters in the film, not just the primary two - that are too rarely portrayed in film, but do exist in our world...As everyone seems to agree, the cinematography and acting are extraordinary. I also thought the story was unique and refreshing, and for me at least, the pacing was perfect. I believe I benefited from having no idea where it was going to go, so I would recommend skipping the trailer and seeing it for whatever reason compels you.

No Man of God gets around that by making the focus of the story Bill Hagmaier, the FBI profiler who interviewed Bundy multiple times in the final years of his life. Hagmaier (played by Elijah Wood) was part of a unit designed to “understand” serial killers, with the hope of being able to use any information they gleaned in investigations later on. Directed by Amber Sealy, the film looks at how he was able to earn Bundy's trust in order to glean such information. The result is a stagey, yet still sufficiently compelling exploration of evil...The bottom line, however, is that this is a film where performances are key. Wood is outstanding, showing how Hagmaier's mind perpetually runs on two tracks simultaneously. On one, he's asking the questions he wants answers to. On the other, he's sizing up his subject, deciding how much he believes and thinking about how to ask the next question in a way that won't make him clam up. Also effective is the way Wood suggests his character's empathy for Bundy as a human being, despite being repulsed by the crimes he's committed...No Man of God builds to Bundy's confession and eventual execution. Those final scenes are intense, as he spends his last hours in a nervous state. The idea is unspoken, but the film implies that he doesn't like being in the same scared-to-face-imminent-death position as his victims. The tables are turned. What happens between him and Hagmaier in those concluding scenes is indicative of what makes this film so engrossing, despite the staginess.

Nowadays, we have the Scary Movies, Spy Hard, Date Movie, Not Another Teen Movie, etc....of all of these, Teen Movie is quite easily the best one. The point of spoofs and satires, to me, are not just to take familiar scenes and do something retarded and gross with them, but instead to actually make fun of all the things in the original movies that, while watching them, we all turned to our friends and said ""wait a minute, thats kind of stupid"". Teen Movie does this extremely well. How many of us lucky movie fans who saw She's All That had trouble seeing why everyone in the movie thought the lead actress was ugly just because she had glasses and a ponytail? She was still a babe! How many of these teen movies give the main lead actress a friend who is clearly into her, but she always seems to ignore any possibility of romance between them, instead pursuing another character and asking for her friend's help/advice? How many people thought the characters in Cruel Intentions were just sexually over the top to the point of being absurd? Teen Movie pokes great fun at all of these flaws. It is, unlike many other movies that attempt to be like it, a true satire, taking characters and not just doing stupid things with them, but exaggerating the traits of their serious counterparts and, when it comes down to it, just making fun of them. It has surprisingly good plot cohesion while still making fun of a variety of teen movies. I suppose the best way to distinguish this movie from all other modern spoofs is that this one is truly intelligent. Sure it has some stupid jokes, and toilet humor (that I admit I chuckled at in disgust like the diarrhea scene and the lesbian kiss with the old woman), but it also has some very clever jokes, like when is it appropriate to start a slow clap, why do these teen movies seem to only have one black character, and how silly is it that things slow down for emphasis when the beautiful female lead enters the room. Please, give this one a chance. If you've seen the other modern spoofs, I'm confident you will appreciate the noticeable and subtle differences between them and Teen Movie that make the latter much more enjoyable and palatable to watch.",Not Another Teen Movie,R,1h 29min,Comedy,2001,5.7,101000,https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.0ea9f702-d15b-05d4-a5af-9881dd74923e?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvs_piv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvs_piv-20,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTRhNWJmNTUtM2VhYi00NzdkLTgyYTUtMWMzMWI3MzFmNzk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjgzMjI4ODE@._V1_FMjpg_UX520_.jpg

The immediate grabbing feature of this movie is its score, very imaginatively composed and created by Alan Silvestri whose other credits include the Back to the Future series and other gems like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The tempo and build up which the score lends to the film engage its viewers with feelings of fear and nerve wracking suspense for what lurks within the thick of the forest. Take note of Sonny Landham's comment;""there's something out there,and it ain't no man...The action is fast, furious and merciless. The commandos are killed off one by one, leaving Arnie, Carl Weathers and the surviving members extremely terrified and on the verge of breaking down. Note the heated arguments that some of the commandos get into with each other. There is very animated and fiery action in the beginning (assault on the terrorist camp) but as we are introduced to the true terror of the jungle (or should I say, outer space), the action takes a turn for the more insane eg.Arnie running away armed only with a knife and trembling in fear, almost drowning in a waterfall and thereafter, continually pursued by the Predator). All this followed by a half hour long jungle battle mano a mano with spears, rocks and fists and hall deafening yells by both warriors.

I generally only write reviews for movies I've really loved, or really hated, and this movie I really loved...This is a masterpiece...I don't know where to begin, really. Leaving the cinema, I felt as though I'd had some kind of accident - a little as if I was in shock. I had a very strong physical reaction to this movie, in tandem with my emotional response, and in many scenes I felt my heart racing. This is powerful material and has been delivered with great skill. The pacing is perfect, moving slowly and quietly toward not one but several emotional climaxes, each greater than the last, allowing the audience to enter Curtis' world and share his emotions. The cinematography was beautiful, elegant, and achingly frightening at times; the dialogue was so real it hurt, and the soundtrack sinister and intense. Michael Shannon should win something for this role - he is Curtis completely and it's a complex and deeply sympathetic portrayal of the confusion of a good man, a complicated portrait of a man trying to BE a good man, in the face of his own fear. From the very beginning, the atmosphere is unsettled, and some of the dream sequences are heart-stoppingly frightening. The story is multi-layered, working with ideas of family, mental illness, responsibility, fear, the current feeling of the-end-is-nigh that everyone senses - when Curtis said, 'Is anyone seeing this?' I almost cried for him...I have thought very hard about this film since I saw it two days ago and I simply cannot fault anything about it, not one thing. I know I'm going to see it many times. It left me shaken and moved and I cannot wait to see more from this writer/director.

Even though this was made by James Cameron, the same director who gave us ""Aliens"", both movies are very hard to compare...When an American nuclear submarine is attacked during the cold war and crashes, the navy is convinced that it was the work of the Russians. They want to salvage the wreckage as soon as possible, because a storm is coming, but they aren't able to send a diving crew of their own that quickly. That's why they contact a group of workers of a nearby underwater oil rig, who reluctantly accept the job. They are joined by some navy SEALS who will help them to locate and investigate the cause of the crash. But they do not only find the crashed sub, they also find out that there is more down there in the deep than what they had ever expected to see...What I liked so much about this movie was that this time the aliens didn't feel threatening at all. It was something completely different from what we were used to see and it worked perfectly. This was a beautiful, well-crafted movie with some very fine acting and with some excellent special effects. Even though this movie was created in 1989, the computer animations were still marvelous and breathtaking. In fact, this entire movie is breathtaking. It is very touching and powerful at the same time and I'm sure that many people will have a lot of difficulties not to show any emotions while watching it. I give this movie an 8/10.

Anyway he falls in love and has to outwit the dangerous gangsters...Val Kilmer plays the eccentric master thief the Saint who has a dark past and an impressive talent for disguise. All the different characters the Saint disguises himself as are memorable. I personally like heroes with a dark past who aren't perfect and have suffered to become who they are today...The chemistry on screen between Val Kilmer and Elisabeth Shue is excellent - and well Elisabeth Shue is beautiful! This is such a fun feel good film (although it does have dark elements to it) that gets better every time I watch it and personally I do find some characters touching especially the Saint himself who Val Kilmer plays perfectly...This film has a bit of everything - romance, comedy, drama, suspense and action and is definitely worth renting and is definitely in my collection!",The Saint,PG-13,1h 56min,"Action, Adventure, Romance",1997,6.2,65000,https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.54a9f793-3a06-f705-5588-b24f836b0785?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvs_piv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvs_piv-20,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM3MjI2YjUtYjk1MS00M2VjLWI4MmUtM2UyYWQyNTVlZGE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc1NTYyMjg@._V1_FMjpg_UX719_.jpg
2106,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033045,2106_10,10,"Would that more romantic comedies were as deftly executed as this one? I never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me catching my breath with excitement. Margaret Sullavan makes a marvellous saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always brought out the best in each other. This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most winning performance, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, that is saying a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me giddy with joy. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought ""Trouble In Paradise"" his favorite, but this one he must surely consider a triumph.

It's heartwarming and has humanity to it along with cute comedic moments. Tom Hanks Russian accent seems forced in the beginning but I quickly got use to it and seemed natural afterwards. Tom plays a very naive and yet kind hearted guy name Viktor Navorski who can't leave the airport terminal because of certain circumstances. And Stanli Tucci put on a believable performance and fit the mood of this movie well. He plays a Frank Dixon who is the head of security at the airport this movie takes place. And is the one that gives Navorski the most difficult time but without him there wouldn't be this story. The comedic moments in this movie really works and is a film the whole family can enjoy. The different scenarios come together in a delightful manner and that is what this film is, it's delightful and entertaining. So parts just seem way too far-fetched and underdeveloped. But that is passable because this isn't suppose to be a really realistic film. In fact it sorted reminded me of ""Forrest Gump"" except it takes place in a terminal.

Every actor gives a part of themselves to us as a gift, but the honest reflection and bravery to show the weaknesses which many people hide, makes this an amazing movie...I am shocked at some of the comments on other reviews; saddened and disheartened that people can watch (even if they did) someone take off their mask and be real, then respond with vileness and cruelty. This was the first time I have ever had the privilege of seeing someone deal with life after fame and call themselves out on the fear and self doubt which can go with living in the light of yesterday. Showing the real struggles, exhaustion, and misunderstanding of a life that could have been stolen by cancer, instead rekindled into faith.
