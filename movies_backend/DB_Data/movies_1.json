{"s_no":"2","raw_data_id":"28","link":"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0074223","txt_file_id":"28_10","rating":"10","review":"And here's yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the Italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror. Emilio Miraglia's \"The Red Queen Kills Seven Times\" is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting, stylish production values, enchanting music, great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences. It's a fabulous giallo (released in the golden year 1972) that belongs in the top-five of every fan of Italian cinema. The storyline doesn't just introduce your average black-gloved & sexually frustrated killer, but blends good old-fashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous \"Red Queen\". At young age, their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings Kitty and Evelyn about an uncanny lady who, once every 100 years on April 6th, kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim. Fourteen years later, Kitty has become the successful choreographer of a prominent modeling agency (even sharing her bed with the general manager) when suddenly the killing spree begins. Sister Evelyn would be the obvious culprit, but she moved to the States recently... Or has she? Complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the Red Queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallo-history. Her face can never be seen, but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim. She's not exactly gentle either, as her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger, dragged behind cars and even impaled on fences! That latter one is truly one of the greatest (= most gruesome) acts of violence I've ever seen! What more could you possibly request? Some classy and tasteful nudity, perhaps? The gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered, among them Barbara Bouchet and a young Sybil Danning. Emilio Miraglia isn't the most famous giallo-director, as he only made this one and the equally recommended \"The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave\", but his influence and importance should NOT be forgotten.","title":"The Red Queen Kills Seven Times (1972)","mpaa":"G","length":"1h 39min","genre":"Crime, Horror, Mystery","release_date":"17 October 1975 ","avg_rating":"6.6","review_count":"2246","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.96acddb6-449b-11d6-ec85-feab6d1a9c51?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvs_piv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvs_piv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZTNkNTE1ZTktYzg0Ny00N2RjLWI1NTgtYTc1M2FmZjdiNDMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjIyNjE2NA@@._V1_UY268_CR15,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

I like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a caf√© to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station. Arnold vosloo and Michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation.

He has never been a very interesting film actor. The best part of this movie is the writing and the wit. Alfred Molina and Patrick McGaw make an unusual comic duo, definitely not stock types. Although one can't say their characters are well developed that doesn't make them any less funny.The version I saw was on HDNET and had subtitles for the Spanish dialog, so that was certainly not a problem. The use of Spanish gives it more authenticity. A very underrated movie, judging by the unusually low score IMDb members have given it. I thought it was fun and interesting and worth a 7 at least. A lot of slick movies with higher scores and making big money at the box office are much less interesting.","title":"Scorpion Spring (1995)","mpaa":"R","length":"1h 30min","genre":"Crime, Thriller","release_date":"20 October 1995 ","avg_rating":"4.3","review_count":"268","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.46a9f76a-8834-0934-d1da-38703f011cbf?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTgyNjU5NzQxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDgwMjYzMQ@@._V1_UY268_CR4,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

This is sort of a Mr. Smith goes to Washington type of movie, with some variations but the same premise. I taped this movie off of cable years ago because I had a huge crush on Goldie Hawn. The story is interesting, but it's highly unlikely that some cocktail waitress will get an important job in the government just because she saved some big shot's life. It made me laugh and made me mad at the same time. It made me laugh because some of the situations she found herself in were so ridiculous, I had to laugh. (POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD). It made me mad to think that our government would set up an average citizen in the manner she was set up. And the speech she made at the end...beautiful.

Seeing Willy Clark(Matthau) and Al Lewis(Burns) two big theatrical comedy actors now reduced on the imbecility from the hard and unceasing old age you can feel only anger and blue. Willy not ever surrender and continue to look work, while Al is tired for players and he is retired to the country in the house to his daughter. The couple in his old time was truly funny and harmony, but out the scene was a continue squabble and to quarrel, and for eleven years after their broken they not talk between. Now if they would work, they must return together another time for do one of his best old sketch for a comedy story TV show. The meets is explosive and liberating for the old questions¬Ö. The Neil Simon's screenplay give a certain corrosive spirit to the story and the melancholy and blue overwhelming the many gags and laughter succeeded to generate a good mix also thanks to a great couple Walter Matthu(Nomination Academy Award as Best Actor) and George Burns(Won the Academy Award as Best Support Actor). The two actors are very believable and real and the their harmony seems almost as they real work together for all that time and that realty they not bear between them. The movie is very touching also for its all consuming reality as the story is narrate and how the report Love-Heat that bind the two actors is totally real part to the strange but at the same time ordinarily comprehensible things to the life.

The film's title in Amsterdam was Keep the River on Your Right, making the sensational aspect of cannibalism somewhat less prominent. Equally important was the loving - and gay - relationship Tobias Schneebaum had with members of the groups he studied as an anthropologist. His reunion at nearly 80 years of age and inevitable leave-taking were very moving. I can only highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving story that is anything but pedestrian.","title":"Keep the River on Your Right: A Modern Cannibal Tale (2000)","mpaa":"R","length":"1h 33min","genre":"Documentary, Adventure, Romance","release_date":"15 April 2000 (U","avg_rating":"6.7","review_count":"797","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.3ca9f75c-74e4-d86e-9e1b-0fa567c6c848?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTYzNDIyMzk2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTc3MTYxMQ@@._V1_UY268_CR6,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

As long as that stands, we will have a set for future Alamo interpretations for the screen. One such with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton was done in this century.But I would say The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory is the best Alamo story filmed I've seen. John Wayne's film is a good one if over-hyped, but it's a John Wayne film with the story redone to fill parameters of screen character of John Wayne. Brian Keith plays Davy Crockett here and gives a fine interpretation of the rollicking frontier character he was.It's a lot closer to Professor Lon Tinkle's book on The Alamo than the Wayne film was and having read the book years ago I can attest to that. Tinkle's book is listed as the source in both films, but Tinkle who was alive back then when the Wayne film was done and he was not pleased with the result.Alec Baldwin was around the right age for young William Barrett Travis, the idealistic freedom fighter who incidentally was a slave owner. Back in the day no one saw the ironic contradiction in that. One thing that was not explored and hasn't been was Travis's hyperactive sex drive. He was the Casanova of the Southwest, he even kept a salacious diary of his libidinal conquests.But the man who always gets the whitewash is Jim Bowie, played here by James Arness. He was a hero at the Alamo to be sure, but his career before the Alamo was that of a scoundrel. He was a smuggler, a slave trader, an all around con man selling land he had questionable title to. But his heroic death certainly redeemed him. No hint of that is in Arness's portrayal nor any others I've seen of Bowie on the screen. And of course he did design the Bowie knife, done to his specifications. That man needed such a weapon.However the main asset that The Alamo: Thirteen Days To Glory has is a full blown portrayal of Antonio De Lopez De Santa Anna, the president of Mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the North Americans who've come to","title":"The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory (1987)","mpaa":"Not Rated","length":"2h 20min","genre":"Action, Adventure, Biography","release_date":"TV Movie 26 Janu","avg_rating":"6.1","review_count":"554","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.f0a9f6fb-e142-37ae-4f9d-1d62750de85e?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMzYzNzA4MzYwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI1ODk1MDE@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

However, the girl is resold to the farmer Louren√ßo (Ot√°vio Augusto) that deflowers her, and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience. Then she is sent to a brothel in a gold field in Amazonas and explored his owner, the despicable Saraiva (Antonio Calloni). When Maria escapes to Rio de Janeiro expecting a better life, she is explored by the c√°ften Vera (Darlene Gl√≥ria).\"Anjos do Sol\" exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in Brazil through the fate of the girl Maria.

Most of the prostitutes are amateurs, and it is impossible to recognize the famous Darlene Gl√≥ria so different she is after many plastic surgeries.

Vivah is just that ¬ñ maybe more. After watching DDLJ, Saajan, and Lamhey, I really thought that Bollywood has reached its pinnacle and will never come up with anything like that - EVER. Boy was I wrong! I went to the store to buy some groceries and decided to pick this movie up along with the new \"DON\" (just so I can compare The Great AB with ShahRukh ¬ñ although the decision is already made in my mind). After debating whether I should waste almost 3 hours on a meaningless movie I decided to watch it realizing I had nothing else to do. When I saw the rating of U instead of an A, I was happy that at least it is something where I don't have to watch scantily clad women with bad acting skills doing nothing but dancing on every opportunity they get and making out with every guy to show that they have more skills in bed than a Hollywood B actress. For the first 5 minutes or so I thought I would again be subjected to meaningless story with bad acting. After all everyone who has seen Shahid Kapor know that he as never gained his fame as an accomplished actor. Boy ¬ñ was I wrong about this movie. This movie grabbed my interest after the first 5 minutes and would never let it go. It was a great movie with a good storyline about the vanishing traditions of our society. I liked not only that the director was brave enough to make a movie where younger generation might not relate to the concept (of arranged marriage), but also that he did it with a conviction (that it is the right thing to do). I have no idea why some people think that the acting was not good. I felt that the acting was great and even though the music score might not be considered the best ever, it was still very very good. The good thing is this music will grow on people with time like it did with me after the I watched that movie a second time.

Jim, AKA Kid Wichita, has a way of making things happen, only trouble is, he usually leaves dead bodies where he's been. Not the sort of mentoring Tom envisions for younger brother Jeff, who likes what he sees in Jim, especially when defending their ranch against local Texas cattlemen.The opening credits state 'Introducing John Barrymore Jr. as the Younger Brother', in this his very first screen appearance. That seemed rather odd to me, particularly since he was addressed as Jeff almost immediately into the story. Approximately eighteen at the time of this movie, he bears a passing resemblance to Sean Penn. No stranger to personal and legal problems throughout his career as well as estrangement from his family, I was left wondering if his daughter Drew Barrymore might have ever seen this picture. I'm inclined to think not.On the subject of resemblances, I was also struck by the thought that the young Robert Sterling looked a bit like Roy Rogers early in his career. Knowing Sterling previously only from his role as George Kerby in the early 1950's TV series 'Topper', I thought he looked out of place in a Western, but that might just be me. His character becomes emboldened by his brother's resourcefulness at creating trouble, and provides some of the edginess to this not so typical story. Minor subplots abound, including the relationship rancher John Gall (John Litel) has with his son the Sheriff (who Kid Wichita kills), and the troubled marriage between Kathleen Boyce (Cathy Downs) and her husband Earl (who Kid Wichita kills). Chill Wills rounds out the main cast as one of Tom Cloud's hired hands, and figures in the somewhat predictable finale.What's not quite predictable is how things eventually wind up there, and for that reason, this Western earns points for following a less traveled, hence not quite as formulaic a plot as a lot of good brother\/bad brother Westerns do. Combined with the eclectic casting of the principals, it's one I'd recommend, even if you have to endure s","title":"The Sundowners (1950)","mpaa":"Approved","length":"1h 23min","genre":"Western","release_date":"2 February 1950 ","avg_rating":"5.6","review_count":"419","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.1aa9f6f9-0321-6eb1-ed66-9f5356edc086?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvs_piv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvs_piv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNGM2OTNhNGQtZTI5OC00YjIzLWI5MDAtZmZmZmYyMzkyNjc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjgzNDU2ODI@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

It suffers from unnecessarily flashy direction and occasional dumbness. But overall, this movie worked. All the elements aligned just right, and they pulled off what otherwise could have been a pretty ugly film. Most of that, I think, is due to Jamie Foxx. I don't know who tagged Foxx for the lead, but whoever it was did this movie a big favor. Believable and amazingly likeable, Foxx glides through the movie, smooth as butter and funnier than hell. You can tell he's working on instinct, and instinct doesn't fail him.The plot, while unimportant, actually ties together pretty well, and there's even a character arc through which Foxx's character grows as a person. Again, they could've slipped by without any of this, but it just makes things that much better.I'm surprised at the low rating for this. Maybe I just caught this move on the right night, or vice versa, but I'd give it a 7\/10. Bravo, Mssr.

One beauty of this film is that it is not pro-American. It is a morality about some Americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion. It is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose.To me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of Fanny and David Farrelly (Bette Davis' mother and brother). As Fanny says, \"We've been shaken out of the magnolias.\"In today's political climate where, led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used 9\/11 to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings, we sunk to the level of the 9\/11 murderers to seek blood-thirsty vengeance. It can't all be blamed on Mr. Bush - after all, we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re-elected him after his lies had been exposed. Now, with complete justification, we Americans are reviled throughout the world.Today, we watch this film with a new awareness: That the rise to power of Nazis in Germany was not due to a flaw in the German character, but, a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts. I'm not comparing George Bush to Adolph Hitler. But, I am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hyper-nationalism to do despicable things.Sadly, the blackmailer, who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement, no matter how immoral, is most like the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand, that they can't even be bothered to vote.A film like Watch on the Rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be - a force for the betterment of humanity - and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals.","title":"Watch on the Rhine (1943)","mpaa":"Approved","length":"1h 54min","genre":"Drama, Thriller","release_date":"27 August 1943 (","avg_rating":"7.3","review_count":"3925","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.4ea9f78d-264c-fbe8-4961-f3191a3fcff7?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BM2ZmMDhjNmQtN2MxNy00MTdmLTg4MTEtZTVkMTFmZDg0NTNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

Iphigenia, however, is a highlight. Adapted by Cacoyannis from the play by Euripides, it's a superior rendering of the classic tragedy and recently made its first television appearance in many years in the United States courtesy the Flix Channel. The film is shot on an epic scale but is decidedly not a 'big' film, with the emphasis placed on the simple story: in supplication to the gods, King Agamemnon (Kostas Kazakos)is compelled to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia (Tatiana Papamoschou), much to the consternation of Queen Clytemnastrae (Irene Papas). Kazakos and Papas are both outstanding, but it is the stunning Papamoschou who brings the most interesting elements to the screen, blending the innocence of childhood with the dawning realization that she is the pawn in a political game. Strongly recommended for fans of international cinema.","title":"Iphigenia (1977)","mpaa":"Not Rated","length":"2h 7min","genre":"Drama","release_date":"20 November 1977","avg_rating":"7.7","review_count":"1566","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.7eaa7068-7727-f4b9-8edb-af4d93fb9d71?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvs_piv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvs_piv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZmFkZTUwZjktZjFhNi00YzRlLWE5YTctMTdkMTQ1MjJmNTI4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM0NzcxMQ@@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

Like Wells and the original radio broadcast this movie will take you away to a land of alien humor and sci-fi paraday. 'Captain Zippo died in the great charge of the Buick. He was a brave man.' The Jack Nicholson impressions shine right through that alien face with the dark sun glasses and leather jacket. And always remember to beware of the 'doughnut of death!'

The poster is possibly the funniest I've ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my dorm this September.Every element came together in this movie so beautifully. It's not often you see a movie with so many penis, gay, and racial jokes so praised by critics. Carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally. Carell remains sweet throughout the entire movie where by the end of the movie you're rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid. The supporting cast is brutal, each of them having some problems with the ladies themselves.One of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we're given. This is what makes a movie easy to remember fondly. This movie will often be brought up when the words \"chest waxing\" and \"condoms\" are mentioned in conversation.Watching it in the theater I was surprised how many older people were there to watch it. I saw a group of four mid-60s women come in. Despite an older audience, this movie still filled the entire theater with laughter.I think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the Office and Steve Carell. A lot of the jokes remind me of the type of jokes you'd see on Family Guy, too. The movie is shallow enough for adolescent boys and still sweet and clever enough for middle aged women.I don't recommend going to this movie if you aren't a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended. However, when you are at the movie, just remember this movie is all in good humor. The jokes aren't \"gay jokes,\" they're just jokes. And they're funny.","title":"The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005)","mpaa":"R","length":"1h 56min","genre":"Comedy, Romance","release_date":"19 August 2005 (","avg_rating":"7.1","review_count":"400900","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.caa9f714-5a8d-bf33-00d4-0b77e7ea36de?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTNjYTA1NDMtZGZmZi00MTdiLThjZTMtZWU1MGYyZjZkNzgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},
{"s_no":"35","raw_data_id":"1783","link":"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0765447","txt_file_id":"1783_8","rating":"8","review":"Criticism of the film EVENING, based on the novel by Susan Minot and adapted for the screen by Minot and Michael Cunningham, has been harsh, so harsh that it may have discouraged many viewers from giving the film a try. The primary criticism has centered on the fact that very little happens in this film about a dying woman's fretting over a mistake she made one summer in her youth, that famous actors were given very minor roles, that the entire production was over-hyped, etc. For this viewer, seeing the film on a DVD in the quiet of the home, a very different reaction occurred.Ann Grant Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) is dying in her home by the ocean and her medication and memories allow her to share a man's name - 'Harris' - with her two grown daughters Nina (Toni Colette) and Constance (Natasha Richardson). As her daughters sit at her bedside Ann relives a particular summer when she was a bridesmaid for her best friend Lila (Mamie Gummer) - a marriage both Ann (Claire Danes as the youthful Ann) and Lila's alcoholic brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy) objected to, feeling that Lila was simply marrying a man of her class instead of the boy she had loved - Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), her housekeeper's son who had become a physician. Harris, Buddy, Lila, and Ann are woven together in a series of infatuations and romances that have been kept secret until now, 50 years later, as Ann is dying. The older Lila (Meryl Streep) visits Ann at the end and the secrets are revealed: 'there are no such things as mistakes - life just goes on.' The film is a delicate mood piece and the script by Minot and Cunningham is rich in atmosphere and subtle life lessons. Yes, there are gaps in the story that could have used more explanation, but in order to maintain the aura of nostalgia of a dying lady's words, such 'holes' are understandable. The film is graced by the presence of not only Redgrave, Richardson (Redgrave's true daughter), Collette, Gummer (Streep's true daughter), Meryl Streep, Claire Danes, Eileen Atkins, Glenn Close, Hugh Dancy and Patrick Wilson, but also with an ensemble cast of brief but very solid performances.

Classified PG.It was the quintessential comedy of the decade. It won Sir John Gielgud the Academy Award. It was even featured in VH1's \"I Love the 80's.\" And it looks just as good today as it did upon it's initial release. Arthur is the acclaimed comedy classic about a drunken millionaire (played with enthusiasm and wit by Dudley Moore in an Oscar-nominated performance) who must choose between the woman he loves and the life he's grown accustomed to. While the basic plot is one big cliche, there's nothing trite about this congenial combination of clever dialogue and hilarious farce. Arthur Bach is essentially nothing more than a pretentious jerk, but you can't help but like him. Especially when he delivers lines such as, \"Don't you wish you were me? I know I do!\" He's also a delineation from the archetypical movie hero: unlike most wealthy characters we see on the silver screen, he's not ashamed of being filthy rich. In one scene, a man asks him, \"What does it feel like to have all that money?,\" to which he responds, \"It feels great.\" Moore lends such charisma and charm to a character that would otherwise be loathed by his audience. And Gielgud is simply perfect as the arrogant servant, addressing his master with extreme condescension in spite of the fact that his salary depends on him. Arthur is one of those movies that doesn't try to be brilliant or particularly exceptional: it just comes naturally. The screenplay -- which also earned a nod from the Academy -- is saturated with authentic laugh-out-loud dialogue. This is the kind of movie that, when together with a bunch of poker buddies, you quote endlessly to one another. It also looks at its characters with sincere empathy. There have been a number of comedies that attempt to dip into drama by including the death or illness of a principal star (including both Grumpy Old Men's), but few can carry it off because we just don't care. When this movie makes the dubious decision to knock off the butler, it actually works, because we genuinely like these people.

Carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire. The female vampire Una certainly is the coolest vampire since Blade's Deacon Frost. Unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene (why didn't Carpenter use more of this??) this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been. I expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nicely choreographed fight sequence (for example inside a city) and was left somewhat disappointed. While \"Los Muertos\" proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor, it still drags a little in some parts (though nowhere near as bad as \"Vampires\" did). Much like \"Vampires\" however this movie's climax near the end is not very intense.Most of the above may sound like \"Los Muertos\" is a bad movie but it definitely isn't. It is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre. It is neither an unoriginal Dracula remake (like almost every other vampire movie out there) nor is it an unintelligent action spectacle like Blade II. It simply could have used a bit more excitement.I'd really like to see a third installment made by Carpenter but it's probably not going to happen.SPOILER WARNING The ending was way too predictable. Una should have gotten away- that would have made the movie quite unusual.","title":"Vampires: Los Muertos (2002)","mpaa":"R","length":"1h 33min","genre":"Action, Horror, Thriller","release_date":"27 June 2003 (Sp","avg_rating":"4.6","review_count":"6984","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.aaa9f7c3-f501-4797-1fed-cbe1730e5b49?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTM0Nzg5NzM3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTEzMDgxMQ@@._V1_UY268_CR1,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

I am wondering: what do people expect of such kind of movie? Are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it?\"Creep\" is a HORROR movie and it is a pretty good one! This automatically means: it has a absurd story full of holes, outrageous hazards and simple one-side-characters. So why complain about it? Just take some popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable in your seat and then... ...enjoy to be scared to death! The first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing else than Kate and a lonely subway station are incredibly scaring. There is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some jerks just because of a sudden sound of a blinking neon lamp in the back of you. (In my opinion the sound editor did the best job in this movie.)When Kate meet her pursuer the quality of the movie drops but it still doesn't become a bad movie. The second part of the movie is not scary at all, but the gore effects are well done and the story is quite well developed. (...as long as you keep in mind that it is a horror movie you are watching and not the Discovery Channel!) So, if you want to make yourself a very, very scaring hour. Just watch the first hour of \"Creep\" and then leave the cinema or turn of your TV. You know the rest of the story anyway, don't you? The bad guy will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie up to its end, you will not be disappointed....and if you want to push anxiety to the next level, do what I did after watching this movie: leave the cinema by dark night, go to the next subway station and take the last train home...","title":"Creep (2004)","mpaa":"R","length":"1h 25min","genre":"Horror, Mystery, Thriller","release_date":"28 January 2005 ","avg_rating":"5.6","review_count":"28402","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.8cb63c2e-4103-0080-a811-8919fc06ec1c?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvs_piv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvs_piv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNTgzODgyOTQ3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI0MjgyMQ@@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

In Radivoje Bukvic portrayed Goran well.The mixed linguistics brought a nice color to the movie, but I understand why people would get bored with it.The scenery of Hong Kong and especially the stunning Croatian seaside both amazed me, and I hardly wanted to take my eyes off the screen when Largo entered the unbelievably beautiful island.Rolls Royce Phantom; Mercedes S500, and BMW 7; if anyone loves expensive limousine - type cars; this is their movie. It is also a movie for people who love action sequences, good acting, landscapes of extremal beauty, and above all, a fast - paced, well written action movie, with dazzling combat and a thoroughly twined inner drama.My vote, as it has enlightened a gloomy day is: 10\/10","title":"The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch (2008)","mpaa":"Not Rated","length":"1h 48min","genre":"Action, Thriller","release_date":"17 December 2008","avg_rating":"6.5","review_count":"13593","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.88a9f73b-e665-177f-728d-76a43fcfed40?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMjI2MTY4OTkwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg2NjM5Ng@@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

So are Babe and Red, Doc and Big Mac, and even the scenery-chewing mutt Pard. The only thing missing is a good reason for remaking Raoul Walsh's High Sierra 14 years later without rethinking a line or a frame, and doing so with talent noticeably a rung or two down the ladder from that in the original. (Instead of Walsh we get Stuart Heisler, for Humphrey Bogart we get Jack Palance, for Ida Lupino Shelley Winters, and so on down through the credits.) The only change is that, this time, instead of black-and-white, it's in Warnercolor; sadly, there are those who would count this an improvement.I Died A Thousand Times may be unnecessary ¬ñ and inferior ¬ñ but at least it's not a travesty; the story still works on its own stagy terms. Earle (Palance), fresh out of the pen near Chicago, drives west to spearhead a big job masterminded by ailing kingpin Lon Chaney, Jr. ¬ñ knocking over a post mountain resort. En route, he almost collides with a family of Oakies, when he's smitten with their granddaughter; the smiting holds even when he discovers she's lame. Arriving at the cabins where the rest of gang holes up, he finds amateurish hotheads at one another's throats as well as Winters, who throws herself at him (as does the pooch). Biding time until they get a call from their inside man at the hotel, Palance (to Winter's chagrin) offers to pay for an operation to cure the girl's deformity, a gesture that backfires. Then, the surgical strike against the resort turns into a bloodbath. On the lam, Palance moves higher into the cold Sierras....It's an absorbing enough story, competently executed, that lacks the distinctiveness Walsh and his cast brought to it in 1941, the year Bogie, with this role and that of Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon, became a star. And one last, heretical note: Those mountains do look gorgeous in color.","title":"I Died a Thousand Times (1955)","mpaa":"Passed","length":"1h 49min","genre":"Crime, Drama, Film-Noir","release_date":"9 November 1955 ","avg_rating":"6.4","review_count":"942","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.32a9f74a-ace4-b22a-7f6b-f1b25886dafb?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BOGMzNzgzOTEtMjE0Yy00NmYwLWIzZTktMzczOTNmODA1ZjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

We were three years into the film production code... Barbara Stanwyck had starred in the original play, but here, Carole Lombard plays Maggie King. Co star Fred MacMurray is probably best known for \"Double Indemnity\", with Stanwyck, as well as his hit TV show \"My Three Sons\". Keep an eye out for a young Dorothy Lamour (Bob Hope movies) and the too-fabulous Franklin Pangborn, who spiced up just about every film put on tape. Of course, he works in the beauty salon on the ship! Add the sublime Charles Butterworth and Anthony Quinn. Good timing and clever banter at the beginning. Maggie's buddy Ella is played by Jean Dixon, who was the best friend in \"Holiday\" and \"My Man Godfrey\". In \"Swing High\", Maggie the tourist meets a soldier who is leaving the army. Maggie misses her boat when it leaves port and gets tangled up with the soldier. The dashing 20-something Quinn has a small scene at the local bar in Panama where Johnson (MacMurray) has been playing the trumpet. Maggie, Harry (Butterworth), and Skid band together and try to figure out how to get back to the States. Some good singing by Lamour. Good (but brief) acting performance by Cecil Cunningham as \"Murph\", the wise, helpful owner of the local saloon in Panama. While others have lamented at how bad it is, it wasn't so awful, and is even a little exotic, with the fake Central America locale setting for the first half of the film.","title":"Swing High, Swing Low (1937)","mpaa":"Passed","length":"1h 32min","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Musical","release_date":"12 March 1937 (U","avg_rating":"6.2","review_count":"660","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.38a9f701-6c62-44b5-b5c6-4d1e78179116?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvs_piv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvs_piv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BNTZjMTNmODYtYjFlNC00OGU5LTg4MTAtNDEzYTc0ZjM1MWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjE5MjUyOTM@._V1_UY268_CR15,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

The acting is magnificent, the 70mm cinematography is gorgeous, the Oscar-nominated costumes and sets are stunning, and Patrick Doyle's score (also Oscar-nominated) is sensitive and moving. Oh yeah - the screenplay, by some guy named Will S., isn't too bad either. Film critics ribbed Branagh for receiving the films' fourth Oscar nod for \"adapting\" the screenplay, but his decision to use the full text was a gutsy one. I can't think of many better ways to make four hours fly by.Nearly every decision Branagh makes works brilliantly: the use of England's Blenheim Palace for exteriors, the Edwardian dress, and the staging of \"To be or not to be\" in a hall of mirrors, to name a few. The casting of Hollywood luminaries such as Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in minor parts can be distracting, but that's nitpicking. The principal cast excels: Derek Jacobi captures the conflicted nature of Claudius; Kate Winslet acutely depicts Ophelia's descent into madness; Julie Christie brings passion to her portrayal of Gertrude; Richard Briers is pitch-perfect as the conniving Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell elevates the potentially thankless role of Horatio to the apotheosis of true friendship. Every speech, every line, every word is delivered with passion and conviction; there isn't a wasted moment in the entire film. The final scenes magnify the extent of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptations.Branagh's \"Hamlet\" is a bold, ambitious, and ultimately successful attempt to match the grandeur and poetry of Shakespeare's language with equally eloquent imagery. It's arguably the greatest Shakespearean adaptation ever filmed ¬ñ strong praise, but well deserved.","title":"Hamlet (1996)","mpaa":"PG-13","length":"4h 2min","genre":"Drama","release_date":"25 December 1996","avg_rating":"7.7","review_count":"36246","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.4ea9f73f-16fd-a5fc-482d-2c9fdf9da1d5?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BM2U5OWM5NWQtZDYwZS00NmI3LTk4NDktNzcwZjYzNmEzYWU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMwMjk0MTQ@._V1_UY268_CR1,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

That doesn't stop me from enjoying this film, it has a lot going for it. It has all that a movie needs, a plot with beginning, middle, and end, plus all those parts are intelligently written. The film is edgy both in acting and storyline, something a film-noir but with tights. The story is both exciting and meaningful, this is a movie with a message that isn't too preachy. I am still amazed this was shot over 12 days, oh the glory days of Hollywood, when we didn't have to wait 5 years just to see if the movie would fall into development hell... The film is polished and expertly made, directed by Lee \"Roll'em\" Sholem, best known for directing with both speed and efficiency. It never lets the constraints of technology slow it down, in fact there is some creative things done to create the effect of flight, including putting a camera on a boom on a truck and shooting high and traveling fast to make it look like we are seeing it from Superman's point of view, also a few closeups of George in process work, and a long shot of an animated Superman. This is now available on DVD as an extra feature on the first season of the George Reeves Television series.

Boy, it sure contained the elements I expected, and delivered so much more. A constant I'm discovering in these films is the toughness and grit of the actresses in the roles of prisoners preparing for escape while their threshold, tolerance, and resolve(..not to mention sanity)being tested by their superiors. While most of them were hired for the way they look naked, because the nature of the genre demands such gratuitous elements, something else emerges, other attributes, such as attitude and guts, that I ultimately respond to.This, as you may know all too well, was Demme's debut for his mentor Roger Corman, and he provides the target audience with exactly what they desire while putting his own stamp on the proceedings. For instance, there are bizarre dreams certain characters have which define their current psychological states(..there's a particular number featuring warden Barbara Steele where she reminded me of Alex de Large of A Clockwork Orange).The film has female prisoners planning a daring escape, tired of the crazed antics of their wheel-chair bound warden and her nutty prison doc, Randolph(Warren Miller). Juanita Brown is Maggie, the tough, sassy sister who is fed up with the environment and will do whatever it takes to get out. She's the one all the girls fear to cross. Erica Gavin is Jacqueline Wilson, the newest prisoner who was busted by police and sentenced for the murder of a cop, unwilling to give up the names of those she was involved with. Roberta Collins is Belle, a serial kleptomaniac, best pals with Pandora(Ella Reid). Belle becomes the obsession of Randolph who promises Superintendent McQueen(Steele)that through a surgical procedure he can remove her violent tendencies.

It is just incredible how the homosexual relationships between author and protagonists are sublimated in the movie. The reporter is straight, the protagonists are more beatniks than gay.The film starts slowly, but on reviewing it a second time, we get all sorts of interesting information from similes that the writer\/director Brooks creates.Notice the incredible cutting at the beginning where killers and to-be-killed are linked. Cutter on the phone is matched-cut to Perry on the phone. Cutter washing his face is matched-cut to Perry washing his face. Only Perry's looking in the mirror and seeing his eroticized male body sets off a fantasy of his playing a guitar in Las Vegas to empty chairs. This failure\/fantasy matches the failure-fantasy that Perry tells us about his father who built a beautiful motel in Alaska only to find it perpetually empty.Dick talks about shooting pheasants and the fact that the pheasants don't know that that they're going to die. we cut to the Clutters.Perry talks his dream about a yellow bird, \"Taller than Jesus\" who attacks the Nuns who have persecuted them. \"The Nuns begged for mercy,\" he tells us, \"But the bird slaughtered them anyway.\" The bird lifted Perry to paradise. Strangely, Perry says that he has an aversion to Nuns, God and Religion. This echoes later in his last words when he wants to apologize but does not know to whom.The director puts in all sorts of what-ifs and only-ifs.Nancy Cutter gets an offer to sleep at a friends house. She is holding a horse. Perry will comment on a picture of her and the house later on. Nancy can't sleep over at her friends' house because her boyfriend is coming over for dinner. The decision seals her fate.Perry talks of Bogart in \"Treasure of Sierra Madre\". But it is another Bogart picture, \"Beat the Devil\" which Truman Capote co-wrote, where a fictional treasure hunt is the McGuffin. But Dick knows that the protagonists of that film ended up with nothing.

Henry King handles this film with the respect of an epic in all of the small scenes, and Peck is, as always, impeccable. The stirring Alfred Newman sound score, with the stirring twenty-third psalm is unforgettable even after these many years. The scene with Goliath is a bit on the hokey side, but not all that badly done for the era in which this film was made. This goes well alongside the lesser bible epics of the day, \"The Song of Ruth\" and \"Esther and the King.\" It is worth watching, and Raymond Massy is excellent as the prophet Nathan. The film is rounded out by the always fine James Robertson Justice as Abishai and Jayne Meadows as Michol, David's estranged first wife.","title":"David and Bathsheba (1951)","mpaa":"Approved","length":"1h 56min","genre":"Drama, History, Romance","release_date":"10 August 1951 (","avg_rating":"6.1","review_count":"2144","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.58a9f784-79e3-c16b-faf8-f5dca1c9a388?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BZTFmZmZlZDEtMGY0ZC00YmQwLTg5YzYtY2VkYjIxYjhhZmEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDI2NDg0NQ@@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

Jess loves to play pick up soccer games, the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother. However, while playing one day, a passing friend named Jules (Keira Knightley) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling, all girls soccer team. After satisfying the coach Joe (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), she makes the team, something she knows her mother would not approve of. The movie is not about disobeying parents, but rather a girl doing what she wants to do, even if that goes against culture, not just the parents. There is humor thrown throughout the movie, especially when Jules' mother thinks she's a lesbian. The movie does resort to a bit of a clich√© moment, as the big soccer game is the same day as Jess' sister's wedding, but it does not come off a cheesy, but rather fun and light. The soccer action looks good, so sports fans will enjoy it, and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world, the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience. Bend It Like Beckham is not just about soccer, but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time, something that proves to be rather difficult.","title":"Bend It Like Beckham (2002)","mpaa":"PG-13","length":"1h 52min","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","release_date":"1 August 2003 (U","avg_rating":"6.6","review_count":"105149","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.10a9f73b-b934-8383-f6b0-4e10b9d21d37?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTg1Njk5NjczM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjc2NTQ3._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

Zandalee has a torrid adulterous fling with sleazy and arrogant artist Johnny Collins (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by Nicolas Cage). Can the relationship between Thierry and Zandalee be salvaged? Or is everything going to fall apart and go to seed? Director Sam Pillsbury and screenwriter Mari Kornhauser lay on the tawdry soap opera-style histrionics something thick while attempting to tell a wannabe serious and insightful story about desire run amok and its potentially dangerous consequences; the plot goes gloriously off the rails in the laughably histrionic last third. The dialogue is likewise hilariously silly and vulgar (sample line: \"I wanna shake you naked and eat you alive\"). Better still, this flick certainly delivers plenty of tasty female nudity (the gorgeously statuesque Anderson looks smoking hot in the buff) and sizzling semi-pornographic soft-core sex scenes (Johnny and Zandalee doing the dirty deed in a church confessional booth rates as a definite steamy highlight). The tart'n'tangy New Orleans setting adds extra spice to the already steamy proceedings. With his long, scruffy black hair, greasy mustache, foul mouth, and coarse manners, Cage's Johnny is an absolute hoot as the single most grossly unappealing \"romantic\" lead to ever ooze his way onto celluloid. The cast deserve props for acting with admirable sincerity: Anderson, Cage and Reinhold all do respectable work with their parts, with fine support from Joe Pantoliano as Zandalee's merry flamboyant homosexual friend Gerri, Viveca Lindfors as Theirry's wise, perceptive mother Tatta, Aaron Neville as friendly bartender Jack, and Steve Buscemi as a funny, blithely shameless thief. Walt Lloyd's sharp and gleaming cinematography gives the picture an attractive glossy look.

{"s_no":"65","raw_data_id":"2994","link":"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt0024210","txt_file_id":"2994_8","rating":"8","review":"whereas the hard-boiled detective stories of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler have fitted to cinema like a fox in a chicken coop - indeed creating the definitively modern American genre and style in the process - those of what might be called Golden Age fiction have made barely any impression whatsoever. The problem with books like those of Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers or S.S. Van Dine (on whose work this film is based), is that they are low on action or variety - whereas Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe traverse the mean streets of LA, working class tenements, bars, offices, wealthy mansions, and meet all sorts of exciting dangers and violence, Golden Age fiction is generally fixed in location, the scene of the murder, usually a lavish country house, and the action is limited to investigating clues and interviewing suspects. This is a very static procedure, plot reduced to puzzle.This, of course, is as much ideological as anything else, the Golden Age stories dealing with a society hostile to change and movement; the hard-boiled novels recording an urban reality increasingly moving away from a centre (both of authority, and of a city), dividing itself up into hostile, ever uncontrollable and lawless camps. Another major problem with Golden age fiction is character - because we cannot know the answer to the crime until the end, we cannot gain access to characters' motivations or emotions, being defined solely by their potential need to murder. The detective, unlike the anxious, prejudice-ridden private eyes, are simply there to be brilliant, and maybe a little eccentric.The problem with most films from Golden Age books is that they try to be period recreations of the Merchant Ivory\/Jane Austen school, and end up looking silly. There have been successes, for example the radical reworkings of Ellery Queen and others by Claude Chabrol. In the English-speaking world, there have really only been two. The Alistair Sim classic, 'Green For Danger', works because it pushes the form almost into parody, while never betraying the integrity or interest of the mystery.Before that came Michael Curtiz's bri","title":"The Kennel Murder Case (1933)","mpaa":"Passed","length":"1h 13min","genre":"Crime, Mystery","release_date":"28 October 1933 ","avg_rating":"6.9","review_count":"3180","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.8eb146a5-5788-50c9-eafa-bafe34d3e2d1?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvs_piv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvs_piv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTQ5ODQ2MzU2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjczNzkxMjE@._V1_UY268_CR1,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},

Greene's entertainments that were filmed during the war either required transplanting to American shores, as in This Gun for Hire, or the use of American actors in roles where they did not fit. Bacall fits that part here. I kept waiting for her to whistle and bring Bogie to life; her tone of voice is simply all wrong for an upper class Englishwoman. But listen to the dialogue! No, people don't talk that way except in books, but Greene was sending a message about an England that needed to wake up to the dangers of the world. One other positive note: Greene's range of characters were kept whole. While Mr. Mukerjee resembled more a Brahamin, at least his nationality was kept, and his final conversation with Paxinou is priceless.","title":"The Karate Killers (1967)","mpaa":"Approved","length":"1h 29min","genre":"Comedy, Crime, Thriller","release_date":"7 April 1967 (US","avg_rating":"5.1","review_count":"519","prime_view_link":"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/video\/detail\/amzn1.dv.gti.50a9f782-28f0-02bb-101e-3cc31a98e83e?ref_=imdbref_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv&tag=imdbtag_tt_wbr_pvt_aiv-20","image_link":"https:\/\/m.media-amazon.com\/images\/M\/MV5BMTU2MjQ5OTg3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5NzI1NjE@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg","notes":""},
